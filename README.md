# Applied-Graph-Modeling-Toolkit

Toolkit for modeling network graphs under the Erdos-Renyi Random Graph Model and the Binary Stochastic Block Model. Partitioning done using convex optimization search of Fiedler vector under three separate instances of a weight matrix, graph laplacian, and symmetric normalized graph laplacian.
